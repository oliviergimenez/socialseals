# Integrated population modeling for social species: A case study with elephant seals

This repository contains `R` codes to reproduce the analyses from our paper 'Integrated population modeling for social species: A case study with elephant seals' submitted to Wildlife Biology. The text files contain data, while the R scripts do the following tasks:

* `ipm_with_a_estimated.R`: fit an IPM; all estimates in the paper are from this model
* `ipm_with_a_fixed.R`: fit an IPM with parameter a fixed to test the sociality hypothesis
* `countmodel_with_a_estimated.R`: R script w/ code to fit a model to counts only
* `countmodel_witha_fixed.R`: R script w/ code to fit a model to counts only with parameter a fixed to test the sociality hypothesis
